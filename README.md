# revision-bot
Ever since starting my A-Levels, me and my friends need a helpful and persistent revision source. So I came up with this concept as a Discord bot!

# Info
This bot will primarily implement the Leitner Revision System (as inspired by my Psychology teacher) which in a basic sense splits revision into three buckets. One for things you know (once a week revision), ones you kind of know (every few days) and ones you struggle with (every day).
It will also feature the ability to add and sync revision group resources.
